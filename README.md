DeformationTransfer
===================

A very simple implement for the first step of deformation transfer that might be
used in my later reconstruction work. The result can be shown in
[https://raw.github.com/JiaxiangZheng/DeformationTransfer/master/data/result.png]

NOET:
-------------------
This implement is so simple that the input data must be finely registered and
scaled to the same scale. And it does not contain a pair corresponding vertex
selection UI.

It depends on external libraries : **Eigen**[1], **FLANN**[2]
